ABSTRACT 

Computer control using hand gestures is a technology that allows users to interact with computers and other devices using hand movements and gestures. This project uses sensors such as web cameras,to develop a system that can detect and interpret hand gestures in real-time, allowing users to control the computer without the need for traditional input devices such as keyboards and mice. Some potential applications of hand gesture control include gaming, virtual and augmented reality, and accessibility for individuals with disabilities. An additional layer of protection to prevent unwanted access is added by combining facial recognition with hand gestures to operate the computer. The main benefit of this approach is that it limits access to the computer to only those individuals who have been enrolled in the system, making it difficult for unauthorized users to access sensitive information or make unauthorized changes.
